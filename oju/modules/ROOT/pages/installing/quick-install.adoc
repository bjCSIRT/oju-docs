:description: Automated Oju installation with interactive script
:keywords: installation, script, docker, ssl, setup, automated

== Overview

The automated installation script handles complete Oju deployment. It configures the Docker environment, generates security credentials, sets up SSL certificates, and initializes all required services.

== Starting the Installation

=== Download Oju
[source,bash]
----
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bjCSIRT/oju.git
cd oju

# Verify installation script
ls -la install.sh - for Linux
Get-Item install.ps1 - for Windows
----

=== Run Installation
[source,bash]
----
# Make script executable
chmod +x install.sh

# Start installation
./install.sh - for Linux
.\install.ps1 - for Windows
----

== Installation Process

=== Step 1: Prerequisites Verification
The script automatically checks:

* Docker and Docker Compose availability
* OpenSSL installation
* `docker-compose.yml` file presence
* Ports 80 and 443 availability

=== Step 2: Interactive Configuration
**Domain Name** :
```
Enter the domain name for your application (e.g., example.com): 
```
Enter your full domain name (e.g., `monitoring.yourcompany.com`)

**Let's Encrypt Email** :
```
Enter your email address for Let's Encrypt: 
```
Email required for free SSL certificate acquisition

**SSL Certificate Information** :

Configuration for self-signed certificate fallback:

* Country Code (2 letters) : `BJ`
* State/Province : `Littoral`
* City : `Cotonou`
* Organization : `Your Company`
* Organizational Unit : `IT Department`

=== Step 3: Automatic Generation
The script automatically generates:

* **PostgreSQL Password** : 16 secure random characters
* **Redis Password** : 16 secure random characters  
* **Django Secret Key** : 32 base64-encoded characters
* **Environment File** : Complete application configuration

=== Step 4: Image Building
[source,bash]
----
# Script automatically executes
docker-compose build
----
Builds custom Docker images for all services.

=== Step 5: SSL Configuration
**Staging Mode (recommended for testing)** :
```
Do you want to use Let's Encrypt staging mode (for testing without rate limits)? (y/N): 
```
* `y` : Test certificates (not trusted by browsers)
* `N` : Production certificates (limited to 5/week/domain)

**Automatic Process** :

1. Nginx service startup
2. Let's Encrypt certificate request
3. If failed: self-signed certificate generation
4. Nginx reload with new certificates

=== Step 6: Service Startup
Sequential service launch:

1. **PostgreSQL and Redis** : Data services
2. **Django Backend** : API and business logic
3. **Vue.js Frontend** : User interface  
4. **Celery Workers** : Asynchronous processing
5. **Nginx** : Reverse proxy with SSL

=== Step 7: Superuser Creation
**Admin Account Configuration** :
```
Enter superuser username (at least 3 alphabetic characters): 
Enter superuser email: 
Password: 
Password (again): 
```

The script validates and verifies creation with up to 5 automatic attempts.

== Installation Results

=== Deployed Services
Automatic container verification:
[source,bash]
----
# Script displays final status
docker-compose ps

# All services should show "Up"
----

=== Application Access
Upon successful installation:
```
================================================================
Installation completed successfully!

You can access your application at:
https://yourdomain.com

To access the Django admin interface:
https://yourdomain.com/admin
================================================================
```

=== Generated Files

* **`.env`** : Complete environment configuration
* **`nginx/ssl/`** : SSL certificates (if self-signed)
* **Docker Volumes** : Persistent service data

== Error Handling

=== Missing Prerequisites
```
[ERROR] Docker is not installed. Please install Docker first.
```
**Solution** : Install missing tools according to xref:installing/prerequisites.adoc[Prerequisites]

=== Port Conflicts
```
[WARNING] Ports 80 or 443 are already in use.
Continue anyway? (y/N): 
```
**Solutions** :

* Stop services using these ports
* Choose to continue (may cause conflicts)

=== Let's Encrypt Certificate Failure
```
[WARNING] Failed to obtain Let's Encrypt certificate. Self-signed certificates will be used.
```
**Possible Causes** :

* DNS not configured correctly
* Domain inaccessible from Internet  
* Let's Encrypt rate limits reached

**Fallback** : Self-signed certificates generated automatically

=== Superuser Creation Failure
```
[ERROR] Failed to create superuser after 5 attempts. Installation aborted.
```
**Solutions** :

* Check logs: `docker-compose logs backend`
* Verify database connectivity
* Restart installation
* Access backend container and execute  ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser```


=== Optional Cleanup
```
Do you want to clean up unused Docker resources? (y/N): 
```
Removes unused Docker images and containers to free disk space.

=== Next Steps
1. Configure advanced settings in xref:installing/config-file.adoc[Configuration File]
2. Review xref:installing/first-launch.adoc[First Launch] for verification procedures
3. Access the interface to begin monitoring setup


Your Oju installation is now complete and ready for production use!
